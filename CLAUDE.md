# Bash commands

- npm run build: Build the project
- tsc: Run the typechecker

# Core Principles

- Always make a plan before starting to write tests or implement changes
- Always practice Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Create only one test scenario at a time when building new components

# Workflow

1. Read and understand related files before writing tests or making changes
2. Write a failing test for a single behavior
3. Do not run tests yourself, wait for the developer to run the test
4. Implement the minimum code to make the test pass
5. Do not run tests yourself, wait for the developer to run the test to verify it passes
6. Refactor as needed
7. Repeat for the next behavior
